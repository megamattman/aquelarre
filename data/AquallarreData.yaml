    Crown of Aragon:
        name : 'Crown of Aragon'
        description : >
            Created in 1150 by the union of the kingdom of Aragon and the county of Barcelona, the Crown of
            Aragon in the 14th and 15th centuries had expanded to include Valencia, Mallorca, Sicily, Corsica,
            Sardinia, Naples, and (for a brief period of time) Athens and Neopatras in Greece. Much more
            focused on mastering the sea than its great antagonist, Castile—with whom it had frequent
            disputes until the establishment of the Aragonese throne of Castilian King Ferdinand of Antequera
            in 1412—the Crown of Aragon centered its politics around maritime commerce and the expansion
            of rule throughout the Mediterranean. With the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs in 1469, Castile
            and Aragon are finally joined—though until the rule of Carlos I, their union would not be
            effectively complete.

    Crown of Castile:
        name : Crown of Castile
        description : >
            During the 14th and 15th centuries, Castile is the kingdom of greatest extent on the Iberian
            Peninsula, and it has a major political and cultural influence. Within its borders are included many
            previously-independent kingdoms, such as León, Galicia, Toledo, and Murcia; now all linked to
            the Castilian Crown, which during the 13th century expanded its territory throughout the valley of
            Guadalquivir. During this period, Castile maintained mostly good relations with its neighbors
            Portugal and Navarre, but not with Aragon—with which it had many clashes until signing the
            Compromise of Caspe in 1412, when it instituted the Castilian Trastámara dynasty in Aragon—nor
            with Granada which, despite being a Castilian vassal, ends up being conquered by her in 1492.

    Kingdom of Granada:
        name: Kingdom of Granada
        description: >
            Ibn Al-Ahmar founded the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1238, heir of the great emirates and
            Caliphates of Al-Andalus (often referred to as Muslim Spain, or Islamic Iberia), which survived as
            the last Islamic bastion on the Iberian Peninsula until its dissolution in 1492. During this time, and
            despite the frequent dynastic struggles that shook it, the kingdom maintained itself thanks to the
            many tributes it paid to the Castilian kings and the pacts it signed with the Benimerines of Magreb.
            In spite of this, the Kingdom of Granada suffers a continual erosion of territory until the Catholic
            Monarchs, after a campaign of ten years, finally expel the Nasrids from the peninsula.
            Granadan society under the Nasrids is divided into three great populations:
        people:
            - Arabs
            - Jews
            - Mozarabs
    Kingdom of Navarre :
        name: Kingdom of Navarre
        description: >
            After several centuries of territorial partitioning with the neighboring crowns, the Kingdom of
            Navarre is the smallest of all the peninsular kingdoms in the Late Middle Ages. Although it is
            governed by dynasties of French origin during this time period, it maintains good relations with the
            Crowns of Castile and Aragon, each concerned that this kingdom not become part of the enemy
            crown. In the middle of the 15th century a bloody civil war between the factions of the
            Beamonteses (supported by the Castilians) and the Agramonteses (who received aid from the
            Aragonians) shakes the entire kingdom, a conflict that ends at the beginning of the 16th century
            with the conquest of the ancient kingdom of Navarre by Aragon.
            The population of Navarre is divided among three large groups:
        people:
            - Navarrese
            - Basques
            - Jews
    Kingdom of Portugal:
        name : Kingdom of Portugal
        description: >
            The old county of Portugal belonged to the Kingdom of León, and became the Kingdom of
            Portugal in 1139, under the auspices of the house of Burgundy. It begins the 14th century as a
            Castilian ally.
            During the two next centuries, the two main tasks confronting Portugal are to strengthen its
            territory, and to reinforce the power of the crown in the face of the nobles. The Castilian
            occupation of 1371 end the dynastic pretensions of Fernando I of Portugal for the Castilian crown.
            The invasion brings about the ascendance of the Avis dynasty to the Portuguese throne, an alliance
            with England, and victory over Castile; which allows Portugal to strengthen her power in the
            peninsula even more, and initiates a period of expansion overseas which will carry her first to
            Africa and, in the 16th century, to America and Asia.
            Within the Portuguese territory the following peoples dwell together:
        people:
            - Portuguese
            - Jews
            - Mudejars

people:
    Arab:
        description: >
            For convenience, we use the word “Arab” for the Muslim inhabitants of the Kingdom of Granada,
            though the population is composed mainly of Nasrids—that is, Andalusian Arab descendants of
            old al-Andalus—together with Berbers from Magreb, Turkish Ghulams, and Africans from the
            kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay, in addition to true Arabs from the Arabian peninsula.
            Which group, exactly, a character springs from is immaterial to these rules, so the player is free to
            choose one ethnicity or another.

            Muslims during the first part of the Reconquest. They have their own language, Aragonese,
            descended from Latin, which is slowly being lost after the ascension of a Castilian dynasty to the
            Aragonese throne in 1412.

            language, Asturleonese.

            Besides an exclusive language, Euskara, the Basques possess a culture of their own, based on old
            pre-Roman myths and nearly forgotten pagan rites, a culture the Church aims at converting to
            Christian symbols and ceremonies.

            Peninsula, and they have been imposing Castilian as the common language in all the peninsular

            through all of the Iberian Peninsula and Jewish ghettos—calls, as they are termed in the Crown of
            Aragon—in most of the cities of the five kingdoms. Within them, the Jews attend their synagogues
            and continue practicing their rites and customs, but the protection granted to them during previous
            centuries is progressively dwindling during the 14th and 15th centuries, with slaughter and forced
            conversion occurring within their ghettos, and ending with their expulsion from the kingdoms of
            Castile and Aragon in 1492.

            lower social class, they are permitted to maintain their customs and rites by the Sultan, but with
            severe limitations. They use their own language, Mozarab, constructed of different Romance
            dialects and, unlike other Christian tongues, written not with Latin characters but Arabic ones.

            inhabitants of the Nasrid kingdom. Mudejar communities exist in the Crown of Castile (settled in
            the valleys of Guadiana and Guadalquivir), in Aragon (especially within the Kingdom of Valencia),
            and in the Kingdom of Portugal (where they are numerous in the southern zone of the kingdom of
            Algarve). They live in specific neighborhoods called aljamas or morerías within the cities, where
            they have liberty to continue practicing their religion, their language, and their customs—at least
            until the intransigence and fanaticism of the 14th and 15th centuries begin to forbid them; by the
            end of the 15th century they are required to be baptized, after which they began to be known as
            "Morisco", meaning "Moorish."

            We use this term for all performers who earn their living using their gifts of interpretation, in the

            comedians entertaining the people with jokes and parodies. They don’t usually work solo, but as
            part of a troupe called a “Happy Company” or a “Company of Crazies;” many as settled
            establishments in the great cities of the Iberian Peninsula. The times of most work for actors are the
            summer, when they travel from town to town enlivening the many summer festivals that occur in
            the various kingdoms—those who specialize in this sort of performance are called “strolling
            players,” and Christmas, when they perform the Christmas Mysteries in each village, town, and city
            of the Christian kingdoms of the Peninsula.

            city and is responsible for ensuring the safety of its people, executing the orders of judges and
            courts, and making people comply with the laws of the king and the council within its walls.
            During the day alguacils watch the markets, squares, and places of major gatherings; at night they
            make rounds through the city in groups of two or four. Although alguacils as such exist only in the
            cities of Castile, the rest of the peninsular kingdoms have a similar concept, although called
            something different: in the Crown of Aragon they are called guaita (“guard”), and in the Nasrid
            kingdom they are alwazir (“the official”).

    Almogávar:
        description: >
            This profession can be chosen only by characters belonging to the Crown of Aragon, and despite
            appearances, it can be chosen by Mudejars.
            The almogávar—a term derived from Arabic al-mogauar, “he who pillages”—is an individual of
            peasant origins who dedicates his life to war and sacking enemy territory. As a member of a
            warlike occupation, he is aggressive and ferocious in combat; a terrible force in times of war, but
            little more than a bandit and evildoer in times of peace—with the added inconvenience of being
            better organized and better armed than a normal robber. Almogávars come to battle accompanied
            by their wives and children – who also can join them in combat if necessary – and are accustomed
            to fight on foot, carrying light arms and armor that doesn’t slow movement, especially shields and
            large knives—which they call coltells. Their war cry, “¡Desperta Ferro!” (“Iron, Awake!”), is known
            throughout the Peninsula.

    Ama:
        description: >
            This profession can be chosen only by female characters.
            Amas are ladies of lower noble classes who are responsible for caring for the daughter of a noble
            or king (especially if the mother is away or has died), watching over their charge’s virtue and
            security, and teaching her everything a highborn woman ought to know of life. Although amas are
            accustomed to being very protective and maternal with the girls in their care, many of them end
            up becoming their charges’ friends and confidantes; but they are always ready to serve, counsel,
            and guard their charges.

    Artisan:

            blacksmith, candlemaker, carpenter, cobbler, cooper, glassblower, gunsmith, innkeeper, potter,
            tailor, tanner, wheelwright, etc. They are usually organized into guilds—societies formed by
            artisans who work the same job and who, in exchange for protection of their members and of their
            families, control the teaching of the particular job, the production of its products, and the prices at
            which it is sold to the public, to avoid competition among the guild members themselves.

    Bandit:

            This profession represents the rural robber; he who lays in wait at crossroads far from the cities,
            watching for defenseless travelers. Many times these robbers are no more than simple peasants
            who fell into banditry merely to be able to fill their stomachs, or old soldiers who know no other
            way of making a living. Despite the romantic vision held of the medieval bandit—of the
            misunderstood rebel or the defender of the oppressed, like Robin Hood—most bandits are cruel
            and merciless, because the punishment for banditry tends to be quite ruthless.

            studying the medical arts in universities but instead from the teachings of another barber and
            through daily practice. Besides cutting hair and trimming beards, barber surgeons also do
            bleedings, extract teeth, place leeches, amputate limbs, and perform minor surgical operations.

    Bruja:

            A witch (or sometimes warlock—brujo) who lives isolated from her fellows on the outskirts of the
            village or city. Despite being feared and respected by her peers due to the magical knowledge that
            everyone believes she has, often with reason, she is secretly visited by her neighbors. The bruja
            prepares potions for those in love, cures sicknesses and dispels curses (which sometimes she
            herself has caused), locates objects that have been lost for years, and casts curses and the evil eye
            on all who dare to insult her. But, as opposed to the alchemist or the Arabic mage, the bruja
            doesn’t have true theoretical knowledge of magic, for her power is based on oral tradition, popular
            beliefs, and superstition.

            possible, presenting his miraculous elixirs and other products, each more marvelous than the last.
            Because his remedies and medicines have a better chance of provoking indigestion than a cure,
            the charlatan is wont to live an itinerant life, traveling from town to town in his cart or wagon.

#            This profession can be chosen only by male characters. Those who wish to have a female character
#            with an ecclesiastic profession can choose either Knight of a Military Order or Monk (Nun).
#            Within this profession are included all those who make up the aristocracy of the Christian Church:
#            the bishops, archbishops, and high functionaries of the Church; those men who, in sum, control
#            the institution of the Holy Church of Rome in the Iberian Peninsula. If you wish your character to
#            belong to the lower ranks of the Church, you should instead choose the profession of Priest.
#            In most cases, ecclesiastic offices are granted to second sons of the Upper Nobility, who often
#            don’t have a true priestly vocation. They carry on with their normal life (without marrying—as this
#            is prohibited, though having children is not), often without ever visiting the diocese that they are
#            supposed to guide. For all purposes, the order received is considered merely another noble title, so
#            to determine what rank a character holds, consult the following list according to the title held by
#            his family:
#            Ecclesiastical Rank
#            Cardinal: A bishop of high rank, called by the title Father as a member of the Cardinal College.

#            a baron.     monthly_income: 1,050 maravedíes.
#            Archpriest: A substitute for the bishop in ceremonies, in case of sickness or incapacity of that
#            official. Equivalent to a lord.     monthly_income: 700 maravedíes.

#            Porter: A type of ecclesiastical treasurer whose principal function is to track down all those who

            administrative nature or as a trusted servitor. Therefore, every person who belongs to the court is
            considered a courtier: nobles who live with the king and encounter him directly in their service, or
            others of his family members, or hangers-on. They usually have refined manners, an extensive
            education, and a capacity for intrigue and conspiracy well above average; for the life of a courtier
            depends on both what he says, and what is said about him.

    Dervish:
        description: >
            This profession can be chosen only by male characters.
            The dervish—from the Persian dervix, which means “religious”—is a man who, similar to a
            Christian hermit, puts aside all his possessions to dedicate his life to prayer and to philosophical
            pursuit of Allah. The custom of dervishes is to pray while performing a series of dances, songs,
            spins, and swings while repeating again and again the name Allah until they achieve a state of
            ecstasy.
            Most dervishes live in religious communities called khankahs, which is the closest thing the
            Muslim world has to a monastery. All dervishes are Sufis, religious Islamics who seek direct union
            with Allah through fasting, meditation, and prayer.
            The dervish profession permits the use of rituals of faith. If you have a dervish PC with rituals of
            faith, he should dance and spin while performing the rituals he knows, as this is the way in which
            he is able to contact the Divine.

            Dervishes don’t have possessions or their own equipment, so they don’t have a

            maravedíes a week.

    Ghazi:
        description: >
            The ghazi—a word meaning paladin or champion—is a fanatical Muslim warrior who has vowed
            to wage war against the infidels, to disseminate Islam, and to defend its borders, in a manner
            similar to those who join Christian military orders, although the ghazi can come from any class.
            They are also called al-morabit, “those who live in castles,” because they are accustomed to
            dwelling in fortified communities called ribats, a cross between a castle and a monastery situated
            on the frontier, which fulfill the same function as fortifications of the Christian military orders. Most
            ghazis are Sufis, though some of them may secretly belong to the Ismaili (Shiite) Islamic sect.
            The ghazi profession allows use of rituals of faith.

    Goliardo:
        description: >
            This profession can be held by female characters, though they will need to do so in disguise.
            Although the term goliardo—French gouliard—means, in one sense, vagabond clerics, lazy and
            licentious; the term is equally used to refer to student monks of the first universities controlled by
            the Church, who, as much as the former meaning, enjoy wine, women, and entertainment. They
            are generally young, dissolute, amoral rogues, protected from secular justice by their status as
            monks, and able to receive food and accommodation at parish churches and monasteries.
            Goliardos are imaginative people, without personal economic resources, in love with a life of
            wandering and partying, who despise serious regular work, being more comfortable begging a few
            coins with which to meet their needs. There exists an entire medieval literary trend in which the
            goliardo is the protagonist of tales and stories: THE BOOK OF GOOD LOVE, THE DECAMERON, and
            CARMINA BURANA are good examples of that genre.
            The profession of goliardo permits use of rituals of faith.

    Herder:

            A peasant or slave who works in the service of a noble or a rich merchant, guarding and caring for
            his livestock. This is usually a full-time job, as a herder has to leave at sunrise to take the animals to
            pasture in the fields reserved for them, and not return until nightfall. Herders typically take along
            various dogs to help them guide and protect the livestock.

    Hunter:
        description: >
            This profession encompasses all those peasants who survive by hunting, those being
            mountaineering individuals in most cases, servants of the forests and mountains with little contact
            with their fellows. The hunter or mountaineer customarily hunts with a bow—it is the only
            medieval occupation in the Iberian Peninsula that employs it—and a team of bloodhounds to
            harass, pursue, and pull down their quarry. The sport of flying birds, called falconry, is practiced by
            nobles and kings, so it is practically unknown to the hunter.

    Infanzón:
        description: >
            A feudal lord who lives for and by war, a warrior who serves and protects the lord to whom he is
            vassal, whether that be another noble of higher rank or his own king. Similar to the English and
            French concept of “knight,” without the ceremony of knighthood. The infanzón is the cornerstone
            of the feudal system, being a leader in battle and defender of the values they have sworn to follow
            since infancy; trained in the use of arms since they were little, when they worked as pages and
            squires to other knights. With their social position, their privileges, and their economic level,
            infanzones possess their own arms, armor, and horse, with which they go into battle, waving their
            own standard or that of their lord at the end of their lance.
            In the Islamic world, he is called an arif—“captain of troops”—and is usually an expert combatant
            with a troop under his command.

    Informer:
        description: >
            This name is given to Jews who betray and turn their own people over to the Christian authorities
            in exchange for payment—of whatever type—or simply for the benefit of cheaply acquiring the
            goods of the betrayed in cases of execution. It also refers to those who denounce those Jews who
            have been baptized in the Christian faith but continue practicing their native religion in secret.
            Characters who choose this profession should take caution and practice it in secret, because
            informers do not have a good reputation within the Jewish community, and it is typical for them to
            end up expelled, stoned, or even assassinated.

            stories. Although some jesters perform in streets and plazas, it is most usual to see them in houses
            of grand nobles and kings, where their only task is entertaining their lords, a work so appreciated
            that they are sometimes even rewarded with riches or noble titles—provided that they do well, of
            course; otherwise they might be punished with beatings or sent to eat with the house servants.

    Knight of a Military Order:
        description: >
            The religious military orders—which merge the martial world with the monastic—arose in the
            Christian kingdoms of the Peninsula during the 12th century, when the fight against the Almohad
            Caliphate was at its height. In the following centuries, the military orders gained further strength,
            becoming institutions to be taken into account, with great territories under their jurisdiction and
            enormous sources of income. This profession, therefore, represents all those nobles that belong to
            one of these orders; warriors well trained as religious ascetics, and in many cases, fanatics.
            Moreover, contrary to what might seem the case, women can also belong to a military order, as
            there are many nuns associated with a convent of an order (in this case the two Primary Arms Skills
            should be changed to Heal and Empathy).
            the following are the most important military orders of the Iberian Peninsula:
            Order of Calatrava: Created in 1158 in Calatrava under the Cistercian rule, it
            frequently intervened in battles and politics during the following centuries.
            Their symbol is a Greek cross of red with lily flowers at the tips, and their habit
            is white. Only characters from Castile and the Castilian people can belong to it.
            Order of Alcántara: Founded in 1176 under the auspices of the Calatravan
            order, it quickly became independent and acquired large territories in
            Extremadura and Andalusia. Their symbols is a green cross of the same style as
            Calatrava, and their habit is also white. Only characters of Castile and the
            Castilian people can belong to it.
            Order of Santiago: Created in 1170 under the Augustinian rule, it permits its members to
            marry. This order is deeply involved in Castilian politics during the 14th and 15th
            centuries. Their habit is also white, but they carry a red Cross of Santiago. Characters of
            the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, or Navarre can belong to this order, whatever their
            people of origin.
            Order of Aviz: Founded in 1147 after the conquest of Lisbon, this order vowed from
            the beginning to fight perpetually against the Muslim enemies. Its symbol is a fleur de
            lis cross of green, similar to that of Alcántara, as gratitude for the support that order has
            always shown to Avis. Characters of the kingdom of Portugal can belong to this order.
            Order of Montesa: Jaime II of Aragon created the military order of Montesa in
            1317 with assets seized from the Templars. Their device is a simple red Greek
            cross, and their habit is white. Characters who come from the Crown of Aragon
            can belong to this order.
            Order of Christ: In 1319, King Dionis of Portugal assigned assets taken from the
            Templars to this new order, considered from the beginning to continue the work
            the Templars did in Portugal in their fight against the Muslims. Their device is a
            red and white cross. Characters of the kingdom of Portugal can belong to this
            order.
            The profession of Knight of a Military Order allows the use of rituals of faith.

    Mage:
        description: >
            This profession cannot be pursued by female characters.
            The mage—from the Persian magus, which came, in turn, from Latin—is a gentleman from a noble
            or well-to-do family who has received an instruction in law, theology, and magic since childhood.
            Such characters are usually considered notable sages, with profound knowledge with which they
            can make predictions, interpret dreams, craft love potions, and much more. They are so well
            regarded in the Islamic world that many occupy important positions in government or society.

        description: >
            We use the term mariner for all those who work and, typically, live on the deck of a ship, whether
            the simple fisher who leaves the town shore every morning to fish, the merchant who travels from
            port to port carrying his products wherever they are needed—charging a good price for them along
            the way, the sailor who passes weeks and months raising and hoisting sails, or the explorer who
            embarks on unknown seas to find the Indies or the most hidden parts of Africa.

    Médico:
        description: >
            In the medieval Christian world, the practice of medicine is based on the theories of Galen, using
            bleeding, purgatives, and emetics, with treatments including rest, dosing with particular minerals
            and plants, amputation, and fixing fractures by methods as violent as they are painful. However, in
            the Jewish and Arab worlds, medicine has long been enriched by great scientific study, and the
            beneficial properties of good physical hygiene and a balanced diet are already known, as well as
            the use of specific anesthetic products before starting a surgical operation. It isn’t unusual,
            therefore, for people to prefer the services of a Jewish or Arab médico to those of a Christian one.

            cities in other kingdoms, to those who control the market of a single city, the customs house of a
            port, or a provincial fair, without forgetting all those small peddlers who travel from town to town
            selling their merchandise and buying local products, or the modest ship-owner sending a ship to
            establish a new commercial route through the Mediterranean. In short, this refers to the Medieval
            businessperson disposed to run the risks required if the gain is worth the trouble.

    Minstrel:
        description: >
            We use minstrel to refer to the wandering musician and storyteller who travels from town to town
            to make a living, converting the street or plaza into a stage, especially during important fairs or
            festivals. Some, with more luck and talent, can work in the service of a lord, entertaining him and
            his family with music and with acrobatics, although most of them ultimately grow tired of
            sedentary life and return to the roads sooner or later. In the Islamic world they receive the name of
            hazzan—“singer”—because they accompany their musical instruments with their own voices.

    Moneychanger:
        description: >
            This refers to all those individuals dedicated to changing money from the different kingdoms; using
            balances to weigh coins to determine their worth in local currency, and taking a percentage as part
            of the exchange. They can also perform other types of financial operations, such as making loans
            (charging a high interest for them, of course). They are accustomed to working in the street or
            under a colonnade, using a plank as a sort of table—a plank called a banca (bench), whence
            comes the term “banker.” The work of a moneychanger is looked upon poorly by both Christians
            and Moslems, as they are seen as no more than simple usurers and most are Jews.

    Monk:
        description: >
            While priests and clerics make up the secular clergy, monks make up the so-called regular clergy,
            as they are the ones who accept the regulae (rules) of a monastic order, practicing their vows of
            poverty, chastity, and obedience, while leading an ascetic life of reflection, prayer, and
            contemplation—at least in theory; in practice it is common to encounter monks with a lifestyle
            considerably more relaxed. To achieve the solitude and the peace they so need, religious orders
            build monasteries and abbeys that, with the passage of time, develop into great centers of
            knowledge and of culture, thanks to their copyists and libraries. Inside a monastery, a strict
            hierarchy of ranks and classes is maintained:
            Abbot: The leader of a monastery, responsible for the administration of the same and the
            lands surrounding it, similar to the way feudal lords perform. Equivalent to a Count.
            Prior: Helper to the abbot of a great monastery or leader of a priory (a small monastery
            which may or may not be subject to an abbey). Equivalent to a Lord.
            Brothers: Under this term fall all of those monks who hold a specific function within a
            monastery, whether that be as a dean (in charge of economic affairs), cloistered brother (in
            charge of discipline and fulfilment of rules among the monks), or as the cellarer (butler and
            steward, in charge of buying and selling products necessary for the maintenance of the
            monastery). Equivalent to Burgher.
            Monk: Each of the members of a monastery. Equivalent to Townsfolk.
            Novice: A votary who has taken the habit of an order, but who has not yet achieved the
            status of monk. A novice must wait from one to four years, depending on the order, before
            becoming a monk. Equivalent to Peasant.
            The most important medieval religious orders in the Iberian Peninsula are:
            Augustines: Monks specializing in teaching, they commonly wear a dark habit.
            Benedictines: Wear black habits, from which they are called “black monks.”
            Carthusians: Monks with a white habit who withdraw completely from the world and live
            as hermits within their own monastery. They rarely leave it or communicate with the
            outside, for which reason this is not an order much recommended for player characters.
            Cistercians: A offshoot of the Benedictines, but wear a white habit, for which they are
            called “white monks.”
            Dominicans: Followers of the Rule of St. Dominic, who wear a white habit and black cap.
            The Domini canis—“dogs of the Lord”—sprang up to defend the Church from every type of
            heresy that might try to undermine its foundations. Because of this, the Dominicans are an
            integral part of the Inquisition from its inception.
            Franciscans: Wearing a brown habit, the Franciscans are a mendicant order that follows the
            postulates of Saint Francis of Asisi. They are called friars (brothers), and during the entire
            14th century had various disputes with the ecclesiastical hierarchy for their strict
            observance of the vow of poverty, which they followed to the extent that they begged from
            town to town and city to city.
            Mercedarians: Dedicated to the rescue of prisoners from infidel lands, the Mercedarians,
            who dress in a white habit, sometimes even exchange their own lives for those of captives.
            The monk profession permits use of rituals of faith.

    Muccadim:

            Although at first muccadim referred to each of the members of the council of elders who governed
            the Jewish community of a particular city, in the later Middle Ages the term applies to all those
            individuals who formed part of the Jewish militia; a type of police force that, in a form similar to
            the profession of alguacil, is in charge of maintaining security within the precincts of the ghetto,
            especially at the gates that gave access to that area. They typically had a knowledge of Law, and
            they had the authority to punish misdeeds where they saw them.

    Pardo:

            The pardo is a semi-professional cavalryman of Townsfolk origin, who doesn’t belong to the
            nobility nor acts as a professional soldier. He is treated as a small landlord, an artisan, or moneyed
            countryperson who has acquired enough wealth to pay for a horse and some weapons with which
            he participates in “cavalcades”– expeditions to sack Muslim territory, paying no attention to truces
            or peace treaties. Many pardos are nothing more than bandits and killers who act along the
            Granadan frontier. Of course, the Nasrid kingdom also has its equivalent, the al-mogauar—“those
            who make raids”—who also dedicate themselves to attacking the Castilian frontier.

    Pirate:

            In a similar manner to a mariner, a pirate passes the major part of his life at sea, but he makes his
            living attacking and raiding whatever ship comes his way, provided that it presents a good haul
            without posing a great threat. Although pirates exist on all the seas that surround the Iberian
            Peninsula, those that raid the Mediterranean coast are particularly famous, especially Islamic ships
            coming from Africa or the Nasrid kingdom, as many Muslims consider piracy against the infidel a
            type of Holy War (which incidentally paid good dividends).

    Priest:
        description: >
            This profession can be chosen only by male characters.
            As we said before, we call the ecclesiastics who made up the Church aristocracy clerics. Priests
            occupy the lower ranks within the ecclesiastical hierarchy, the religious workers closest to the
            lowest social classes, from which they often come. The priest or presbítero has been ordained by a
            bishop and officiates at mass, administers the sacraments, and forgives the sins of those who
            confess to him. We find different ranks within the priesthood:
            Parish Priest: The priest in charge of a parish church. Equivalent to Burgher.
            Vicar: Assistant to a parish priest in directing a parish church. Equivalent to Townsfolk.
            Chaplain: A priest who has in his charge a group of faithful not organized as a church or
            parish, but instead within a hospital, prison, army, or private chapel of some noble.
            Equivalent to Peasant.
            The priestly profession permits use of rituals of faith.

    Qaina:
        description: >
            This profession can be followed only by female characters.
            The term refers to a singer or dancer of Arabic origin who alternates between musical services and
            sexual ones. They are quite common in the cities of the Nasrid kingdom in the houses of nobles,
            wealthy merchants, and men of resource, often purchased as slaves for exorbitant sums. In the rare
            moments of peace between Arabs and Christians some quainas may visit Christian courts, where
            they participate in parties and private banquets. Despite their status as Arabs, women, prostitutes,
            and—in many cases—slaves, they are often held in high esteem.

    Rabbi :
        description: >
            This profession can be pursued only by male characters.
            The rabbi is a Jewish priest, knowledgeable in Theology and Hebrew Law, since in order to obtain
            the position he has to show mastery of these disciplines, as well as proving that he carries out an
            honorable life in his community and with his wife—yes, I’m afraid it is obligatory for a rabbi to be
            married, so bear that in mind for the rest of character creation. Contrary to Christian priests, a rabbi
            doesn’t exercise his profession full time, but only on Saturdays and during religious festivals; the
            rest of the time, he is dedicated another profession of his choice—as long as it is honorable, that is.
            The player should choose another profession for the rabbi as his “day job”.

    Ramera:
        description: >
            This profession can be pursued only by female characters.
            The term harlot, concubine, prostitute, trollop, or whore applies to all those women who make
            their living selling their body, whether that be on the street or, more commonly, in brothels or baths
            established for this purpose; establishments run by the municipality, which are marked with a
            branch (rama) on the lintel of the entryway (whence the term ramera). They are often girls born into
            a violent or amoral environment, so that they had to turn to their own devices to survive on the
            street. In the Arab world they are called djaria, which is the name given to a slave who sleeps with
            her master.

            write all letters and documents dictated to them, and also of a notary, as they also draft every type
            of official certificate and transaction. The Muslims call them katib—which means secretary—or
            khasi if they work as a slave, while the Jews call them soferim and grant them a certain religious
            function, as only scribes are permitted to copy the Sacred Scriptures.

            peasants recruited whether willingly or by force—with equipment of poorer quality than
            infanzones, who have also made war their trade and battle their life. Many live permanently
            stationed in a castle or fortress, fending off attacks from enemies of their master, while others end
            their lives lying in the mud of a battlefield. In the Arabic world, soldiers are called askari, which is
            a term used to indicate an expert combatant.

    Thief:
        description: >
            This refers to one of those professions that can be pursued only in the context of a city, in which it
            is easier to pass unobserved, and the possibilities to commit a misdeed and not be caught are
            better than in a town or village, where everyone knows everyone. The thief lives by theft and
            robbery, whether as a light-fingered cutpurse who passes unnoticed or as a brutal cutthroat who
            corners his victims in some solitary cul-de-sac to take their purse, their life, or perhaps both.

    Troubador:
        description: >
            In contrast to the minstrel, who comes from humble origins, the troubadour represents the noble
            and cultured poet; a mix of warrior, courtier, and artiste who dedicates the main part of his time
            composing songs to extol his love of his lady, chronicles of recent acts, or legends of the past. He
            considers himself more a creator or composer than a true musician, and rarely performs his own
            songs, except in very private circles. Often he can neither sing well nor play an instrument with
            any skill, preferring to hire a minstrel to do it for him.

    Ulema:
        description: >
            Although in the Muslim world there exists no priesthood as known in the Christian world, the
            ulema—an Arabic word that means “wise”—also called alfaqui, is the closest thing to it. An ulema
            is a man educated in the Koran and Sunnah, a master of Islamic law (which proceeds from the
            Koran); from which he gains certain religious attributes similar to those of Christian priests,
            including the office of judge, which make him a powerful and influential member of his
            community. Some ulemas have committed the Koran to memory—which requires a 75% or more
            in Theology—and are referred to as hafiz, and considered a master among masters.
            The profession of ulema permits use of rituals of faith.

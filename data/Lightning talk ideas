Whats -

Models of different sizes from 6mm all way and further 1:35 scale

They are expensive to prduce meaning the markey was dominated by very few companies

Then kickstarter came along and now you can get models of any type you want

Wins -

A paintiend miniature can breathe life into a board game, the way its painted
can tell the story of a miniature or really press the themes of a game.

You pick your own complexity, there is no pressure to paint well or even what to
paint, whether you want to bring some color to a table top game or creatre a
diorama to put on display

Painting it very rarely problem sovling, meaning it doesn't require the same kind
of mental focus as work does, in fact once you've got the hang of the color recipes
and techniques you want to implement you'll end up painting by rote and it can
actually be quite relaxing.

Woes:

The start up cost can be quite high, miniatures games are not cheap but you can
get some resonably priced single miniatures from some retailers.  The real money
sink will be in the resources, paints and brushes.

The complexity - each level of complexity comes at a cost, in time, money and patience
sometimes you can find yourself in a bit of a slump, incorporating a new technique
is hard but is always worth it in the end.


Lightning talk ideas

Wins and woes of painting minatures

What is mianture painting

Patining small things to larger things
using a range of tools all of which are quite small

for me miantures from tabletop games, 40k, kingdom death

Its basically a 3d coloring in excercise

From an artists viewpoint you are capturing your subject
in a frozen momment

wins

It can add life to a tabletop game

It gives you a chance to be artistic without doing all the hard stuff:
- i.e. creating the subject

You pick your own level of complexity
- Facial expression
- Lighting and Shadows
- Use non metallic paints to simulate metallic surface

its an activity the doesn't require the complex thinky bits of the brain
that the office require

Some people will even say it looks good

woes

Realsim is hard
- blonde cartoon hair is yellow
- actualy hair is not yellow

the frustration of Creating expression on a face that is smaller than
the nail of your little finger

Wins and woes of painting minatures

What is mianture painting

Patining small things to larger things
using a range of tools all of which are quite small

for me miantures from tabletop games, 40k, kingdom death

Its basically a 3d coloring in excercise

From an artists viewpoint you are capturing your subject
in a frozen momment

wins

It can add life to a tabletop game

It gives you a chance to be artistic without doing all the hard stuff:
- i.e. creating the subject

You pick your own level of complexity
- Facial expression
- Lighting and Shadows
- Use non metallic paints to simulate metallic surface

its an activity the doesn't require the complex thinky bits of the brain
that the office require

Some people will even say it looks good

woes

Realsim is hard
- blonde cartoon hair is yellow
- actualy hair is not yellow

the frustration of Creating expression on a face that is smaller than
the nail of your little finger
